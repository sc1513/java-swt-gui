# java-swt-gui
The program checks inventory from a list uploaded from Excel using Apache POI. The program can upload an excel file, which is then
displayed on the GUI. After that the user can scan in barcodes or type in SKU numbers to find products on the list and mark them as found.
This process is meant to help find transfers and markdowns for retail companies.


In order for the program to work you will need to download the SWT plugins and download the Apache POI jars.
Apache POI Jars will need to be added to the class path.
